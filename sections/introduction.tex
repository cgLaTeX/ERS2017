The dynamics of ordered quantum dot systems can be described using analytic methods similar to those used in electronic transport theories.
Those techniques do not work well when attempting to describe systems with disorder or partial order.
We are using an integral approach to the full-wave framework that describes the dynamics of these more realistic systems, which allows direct communication between quantum dots in the system.
